    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      The website that you're reading right now is powered by a custom Go application and
      Vue application. The HTML and CSS is a custom theme which took me embarrassingly
      long to design ðŸ™ƒ.

    <p class="mt-6 text-lg">
      Everything is hand-written. It runs on my home server, using zero trust from
      cloudflare. Cloudflare is used to automatically manage TLS certificates and Traefik
      act as as a reverse proxy to the sites. I use Ansible to manage the server and make
      deployments.
