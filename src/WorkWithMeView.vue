          I'm available to help you choose your tech stack, develop your application, or
          review your code.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          I have over {{ expYear }} years experience building web applications, APIs
          services using different languages and technologies. I value friendliness and
          kindness in interactions, and simplicity and clarity in code, architecture and
          workflows.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-4">
          I speak both technology and business. I'm just as happy to talk with you about
          return on investment as relational databases. In fact, where the two areas meet
          is where I like to work most.

        <p class="mt-4">
          To start with, we'll schedule a video call to discuss what you want to
          accomplish and then we can move forward from there. Sessions start at one hour.
